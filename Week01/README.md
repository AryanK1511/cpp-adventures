## Intro to Object Oriented Programming

### The 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming

1. **Encapsulation:** Bundles the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object), restricting direct access to some of the object's components for better data protection.
2. **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex systems by exposing only the essential features of an object while hiding the intricate details, allowing users to interact with it at a higher level.
3. **Inheritance:** Enables a new class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent), promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.
4. **Polymorphism:** Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling the same interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types), effectively allowing the same operation to be performed in various ways.
